# MyReads Project
## What's myReads ?
This project was built for the Udacity React Nanodegree Program. The purpose is to demonstrate understanding of the basic structure and operation of a React-based app.

## How to run the app?
* Clone this repository
* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* Launch the app with `npm start`




## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
